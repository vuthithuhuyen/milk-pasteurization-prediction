# A Deep Learning-based Milk Pasteurization Quality Prediction System"
This repository is a part from the paper entitled "A Deep Learning-based Milk Pasteurization Quality Prediction System"

**Abstract:**
Quality of product is always one of the top concerns in manufacturing and production lines. The assessment and classification of product quality can be done by many different methods, such as using manual employment or through the evaluation of machines and equipment. In recent years, with the growth and development of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL), applying DL algorithms in automatically evaluating and classifying product quality in factories is a trend and gradually becoming more popular. This paper proposes an approach to apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in predicting the quality of milk pasteurization. Furthermore, based on the trained ANN model, we develop a flexible predictive system for predicting the quality of the pasteurization process under different temperature conditions. This system will assist workers and machine operators in controlling the temperature of the pasteurizer to achieve the best product quality.

**Keywords:** Pasteurization quality prediction, artificial neural network, deep learning, flexible predictive system.
